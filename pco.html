                <p>To the Team at Planning Center,</p><p>Over the past six or seven years I have had the opportunity to watch Planning Center grow, both through using the product and interacting with the staff. As I have become familiar with how the company invests in its team, serves its churches, and continually seeks to innovate, Planning Center has come to be a company that I have to apply to work for. After attending full-stack a few times and experiencing the humility of the team I have continually kept my eyes open for an opportunity to apply. Having worked in both church administrative and managerial roles in the past I have seen first-hand the help and relief that PCO affords church staff. I would be ecstatic to continue in that service.</p>
                <p>My work experience has taken me down many paths, most of which have been on the project/product management and user experience side of the curtain. In that time, I have learned that being ready to listen first and doing everything with the church, the team, and the product in mind will always trump trying to be the sone with all the answers. I've seen those traits in Planning Center's DNA, and that's why I can't wait to be a part of it.</p>
                <p>Thank you, Craig Grant</p>

                <p>MARKETING PROJECT MANAGER<br> SURF TECHNICIANS LLC | SAN DIEGO, CA | 2017-PRESENT<br>
                • Beginning as a customer service rep I was able to effectively serve our customers and our sales representatives while managing resources to rebrand the company for the first time in over 30 years. The end result was a complete website redesign and my position being updated to the only marketing team member for our company in 5 years.</p>
                <br>
                <p>BUSINESS ANALYST/PRODUCT MANAGER<br> OLIVERMCMILLAN | SAN DIEGO, CA | 2015-2016<br>
                • I had the opportunity to build, implement, and administrate software and related procedures that allowed OliverMcMillan to define and systematize its business process. My responsibilities varied from leading a development team in a ground-up build of multiple apps to end user training and understanding of pain points.</p>
                <br>
                <p>FRONT END DEVELOPER<br> WHAT.IT.IS CREATIVE | AUSTIN, TX | 2015<br>
                • In this position we built primarily WordPress based sites on a small team of 2 designers, myself, and one other developer. We were able to work closely with clients to help them navigate user concerns and business needs ranging from an app for children's stories/podcasts to a multi-national construction portfolio.</p>
                <br>
                <p>PROJECT MANAGER<br> STORYVILLE COFFEE | SEATTLE, WA | 2013-2014<br>
                • My function here was broad. With the function of the title of project manager being for both web development and construction, I was tasked with the continued perfection of aesthetic of the brand while building out and maintaining current store fronts. I built a web store and lead all levels of training staff for deployment. It was truly a "wear all the hats" job and I loved it!</p>
                <br>
                <p>PROJECT MANAGER<br> THE RESURGENCE | SEATTLE, WA | 2011-2012<br>
                • This position opened my eyes to a new level of frustrations that are a part of "modern" ministry. I saw friends and colleagues work tirelessly with little appreciation or reprieve and I experienced first-hand the way that affected the health of the church and its families. That became a driving force to seek changes that would positively influence the lives of everyone in ministry.</p>
                <br>
                <p>BOATSWAINS MATE/PROJECT MANAGER<br> USCG | SEATTLE, WA | 2009-2011<br>
                • As the department lead I was responsible for directing and training all newly deployed recruits as well as encouraging them towards specified training that best suited their strengths. I was young and they were younger, and for the first time I realized I cared more about how people were trained and developed than the end result.</p>

                <h1 id="Questions">Questions</h1><p class="smallnote">(*My schedule over the past week hasn't allowed as much time as I had hoped to refine the usability of this section, I appreciate your grace in its flaws.)</p>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> We'd like to get an understanding of how you see this role. What are your most and least favorite parts of product management? How do you do know if you're doing a good job?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> I love that product management allows me to see physical progress in each facet of the project while still engaging the social side of my personality. I’m relational by nature, so the opportunity to invest in people is not only something I genuinely enjoy, but it also allows a real relationship to develop. In my experience, this helps a team work out of their strengths instead of being worried about weakness or fear.
                </p>
                <p>
                The most difficult part of the product management is when I want to be helpful but can’t. Sometimes it’s my lack of skill, time, or the greater needs of the project, but it’s always more fun to be part of the solution than to bring up challenges and be unable to help see them through.
                </p>
                <p>
                In this kind of situation having an active team that is excited about solving new problems, asks challenging questions, and pushes for better solutions, means that they feel the freedom to discuss frustrations and figure out their mistakes. A product manager is only one factor in the equation (amazing people are 90%), but if if the manager can help multiply that progress and momentum even by a tenth of a percent then I think it's a job well done. I’ve had jobs that make me feel bored even though I’m busy, and jobs that stress me out even though there's not a mountain of work to do. Managing expectations, effective communication, and timeline visibility has a lot to do with those factors. If I’m successful, those on my team will feel free to do their job with confidence.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> What have you found to be effective frameworks/practices for product management?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> I’ve generally stayed away from latching on to any specific framework in the past. I’ve worked in environments where implementing waterfall processes in a company that is already on the agile end of the spectrum created unnecessary confusion.</p>
                <p>My goal is to employ useful tools that allow for clear communication and increased visibility into project milestones. My requirements are only that they increase collaboration and increase the team's ability to get help when needed.</p>
                <p>In that vein, <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> is a tool I have relied on heavily in the past. I appreciate that it tracks ideas from the start and allows them to be easily revisited. It's also useful for creating a catalogue of possible future changes that are visible enough to continue to modify without having to dig deep into a file structure.
                I also love <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, and use it as much as possible. I've found it especially useful when working with remote team members. (But I’m sure you need no introduction.) </p>
                <p>Tools like <a href="https://www.kissmetrics.com/">Kissmetrics</a> and <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a> keep an eye on where users are entering, where they're spending time, and where the biggest bounce rates happen. These tools are primarily used for monitoring retention and sales outcomes, as well as furthering design thinking within UX teams. However, if you have clear channels for direct user feedback, it usually trumps the need to employ tools that add so much cost. </p>
                <p>As far as design is concerned, <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> is a great tool that I wish I had more experience with. I was exposed to it at a smaller company I worked with in Austin for a few months and it really helped create feasibility studies for product features without getting too deep into development. I'd like to see how it has progressed in the past two years, and I"m definitely eager to grow in my ability to think like a designer!</p>
                <p>At the end of the day, my focus is on listening, asking thoughtful questions, communicating frequently and concisely, and helping where I can. Best practices and useful tools come as a team gets to know each other and learns their collective blind spots. Joining an established team like Planning Center is much different than starting with a new team. I would want to learn what is already working and what the primary challenges are and take steps forward from there.</p>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> Products are made by people. What are some of the "tools" in your people management toolbox for fostering and leading healthy teams?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> I firmly believe that fostering team health comes from focusing on the group and individuals separately. The group needs to know what the ground rules are, how we work together, how we address conflict, how we argue, and what we need to do to be successful. When effective teamwork has been defined, teammates hold one another accountable and look out for each other because its a safe place to so.</p> 
                <p>When working with individuals, the responsibility is to provide clear communication and to learn what that means to the other person. We all have different emotional thresholds, backgrounds, fears, and frustrations. None of those should be met with assumptions, and any conflict or impasse should be worked through with care and patience.</p>
                <p>
                Effective communication allows time to plan and prioritize around the task at hand but more importantly, it allows us to share in victories, help one another, and develop the relationships that are a foundational part of a successful team.
                </p>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> What is the work you're most proud of?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> The job that brought me San Diego was an opportunity to automate the business practices of a commercial real estate developer. I was given full access to the staff, and as somewhat of an outsider, I was given very honest insight into each person's role, what they loved, what made it hard, and what bogged them down. </p>
                <p>The experience of being able to take the pain points and help create solutions and watch as improvement team morale increased with each improvement was both exciting and humbling.</p>
                <p>Initially the processes lived somewhere between email folders, massive excel files, and an insane amount of documents. This meant the back and forth communication was a full time job in itself. As we grew the product it was amazing to see what we produced quantified so concretely in the mood of the staff. Prior to this job the success of the products I had managed were solely measured by the profit they produced. Not a terrible metric if you're a salesman, but that's something I never hope to be.</p>
                <p>As it’s not a public application I can’t share much, but here’s where I started:</p>

                </aside>
                <br>
                <p>And here's where that led to:</p>

                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> Great feature design is often the result of healthy debate. Tell us about a time where there was a debate over a product feature. Describe the scenario and how the product was made better for it.</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> I believe that any healthy debate also includes complexity. Complexity most often includes a lengthy explanation, and because of this I attempt to discuss complexity in person if at all possible. Please view my answer here: </p>

                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> The examples that  think are most applicable are from the past 3 years of my experiance and inolved managing products for fairly private organizations for which I've signed a few NDA's. While I cant provide a full outline of the products created, outlined below is the approach I have used in the past.</p>
