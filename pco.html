                <p>Over the past six or seven years I have had the opportunity to watch Planning Center grow, both through using the product and interacting with the staff. As I have become familiar with how the company invests in its team, serves its churches, and continually seeks to innovate, Planning Center has come to be a company that I have to apply to work for. After attending full-stack a few times and experiencing the humility of the team I have continually kept my eyes open for an opportunity to apply. Having worked in both church administrative and managerial roles  in the past I have seen first hand the help and relief that PCO affords church staff. I would be ecstatic to continue in that service.</p>
                <p>My work experience has taken me down many paths, most of which have been on the project/product management and user experience side of the curtain. In that time I have learned that being ready to listen will always trump trying to be the smartest person in the room. I want to serve in whatever capacity I can with the church, the team, and the product in mind. I've seen those traits in Planning Center's DNA, and that's why I can't wait to be a part of it. </p>

                <p>MARKETING PROJECT MANAGER<br> SURF TECHNICIANS LLC | SAN DIEGO, CA | 2017-PRESENT<br>
                • Beginning as a customer service rep I was able to effectively serve our customers and our sales representatives while managing resources to rebrand the company for the first time in over 30 years. The end result was a complete website redesign and my position being updated to the only marketing team member for our company in 5 years.</p>
                <br>
                <p>BUSINESS ANALYST/PRODUCT MANAGER<br> OLIVERMCMILLAN | SAN DIEGO, CA | 2015-2016<br>
                • I had the opportunity to build, implement, and administrate software and related procedures that allowed OliverMcMillan to define and systematize its business process. My responsibilites varied from leading a development team in a ground-up build of multiple apps to end user training and understanding of pain points.</p>
                <br>
                <p>FRONT END DEVELOPER<br> WHAT.IT.IS CREATIVE | AUSTIN, TX | 2015<br>
                • In this position we built primarily Wordpress based sites on a small team of 2 designers, myself, and one other developer. We were able to work closely with clients to help them navigate user concerns and business needs ranging from an app for childrens stories/podcasts to a multi-national contsrtuction portfolio.</p>
                <br>
                <p>PROJECT MANAGER<br> STORYVILLE COFFEE | SEATTLE, WA | 2013-2014<br>
                • My function here was broad. With the function of the title of project manager being for both web development and construction, I was tasked with the continued perfection of aesthetic of the brand while building out and maintaining current store fronts. I built a web store and lead all levels of training staff for deployment. It was truly a "wear all the hats" job and I loved it!</p>
                <br>
                <p>PROJECT MANAGER<br> THE RESURGENCE | SEATTLE, WA | 2011-2012<br>
                • This position opened my eyes to a new level of frustrations that are a part of "modern" ministry. I saw friends and colleagues work tirelessly with little appreciation or reprieve and I experienced first hand the way that affected the health of the church and its families. That became a driving force to seek changes that would positively influence the lives of everyone in ministry.</p>

                <p>BOATSWAINS MATE/PROJECT MANAGER<br> USCG | SEATTLE, WA | 2009-2011<br>
                • As the department lead I was responsible for directing and training all newly deployed recruits as well as encouraging them towards specified training that best suited their strengths. I was young and they were younger, and for the first time I realized I cared more about how people were trained and developed than the end result.</p>

                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> Tell us about a situation where you made a mistake when leading a team. What happened and how did you deal with it?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> My first soirée into managing a product team was also my first real encounter with working as part of a remote team. I was new to the role and new to the company. With a very active boss, it became easy to get so wrapped up in my own workload that I wasn't making myself available to my team. Certain aspects of the project began struggling and for the most part it stemmed from either lack of direction, someone feeling stuck and not knowing how to ask for help, or simply a lack of awareness of blind spots with no one to help bring a fresh perspective. Luckily one of the teams developers called me out. We talked about what he thought the solution could be and presented it to the team. The team agreed that I would schedule checkins with the expectation that each would take less than 5-10 minutes, unless more time was warranted.</p>

                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> Give us an example of a product that you love or you hate and why.</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> Oh, wow. I think right now it has to be <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=%28roi%29%20branded&utm_content=ynab&utm_term=ynab&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4_zVBRDVARIsAFNI9eBnI1NEa9Mk_E50fshlWxy92ukEAhIs7Ah0aPm18NbVwtS6dFIYoPEaAp9yEALw_wcB#homeRuleOne">YNAB</a>. My wife will tell you that budgeting has not always been my strong suit, but after 3+ years using this tool, seeing their growth, and watching the way they listen to and care for their customers, I'm sold.</p><br><p>They have created a clean, intuitive tool, that has made my life easier, and their <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/features/#reportingbliss">reporting tools</a> are actually fun.

                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> Tell us about a situation where you had to influence others who disagreed with you. What happened and how did you deal with it?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> I had been in my current role as a customer service rep for about three months. The company is small and has been around for 30+ years. In the past 5 years they've seen turnover of ownership, fluctuating product focus, and an unhealthy view from the target audience, none of which had been given the attention they needed. As a consumer of the product, and now an employee of the company, I was itching to do something about it. I was told there was no time or money to spend on a rebrand, and no way we could change perception. "It is what it is, we just need to find new customers."</p> 
                <p>Being that I can be slightly... stubborn, I started reaching out to friends that new the brand. I found a designer and a copywriter that were willing to help me out in exchange for beer and food while we worked and the possibility of a product trade if we won over my team. After we dialed in our proposal I brought in our product director and VP of sales and pitched our work. We won them over not because it was perfect, but because we showed care, patience, took direction, and stayed positive. After having been at the company 8 months at this point we landed on new iconography, a new product line, and a brand/marketing guide. Patience, care, and communication won out. </p>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> How did you hear about this job?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> I check the site every few weeks for possible openings, but Dan Ott gave me the heads up this time around.</p>
