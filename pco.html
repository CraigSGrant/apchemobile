                <p>To the Team at Planning Center,</p><p>Over the past six or seven years I have had the opportunity to watch Planning Center grow, both through using the product and interacting with the staff. As I have become familiar with how the company invests in its team, serves its churches, and continually seeks to innovate, Planning Center has come to be a company that I have to apply to work for. After attending full-stack a few times and experiencing the humility of the team I have continually kept my eyes open for an opportunity to apply. Having worked in both church administrative and managerial roles in the past I have seen first-hand the help and relief that PCO affords church staff. I would be ecstatic to continue in that service.</p>
                <p>My work experience has taken me down many paths, most of which have been on the project/product management and user experience side of the curtain. In that time, I have learned that being ready to listen first and doing everything with the church, the team, and the product in mind will always trump trying to be the sone with all the answers. I've seen those traits in Planning Center's DNA, and that's why I can't wait to be a part of it.</p>
                <p>Thank you, Craig Grant</p>

                <p>MARKETING PROJECT MANAGER<br> SURF TECHNICIANS LLC | SAN DIEGO, CA | 2017-PRESENT<br>
                • Beginning as a customer service rep I was able to effectively serve our customers and our sales representatives while managing resources to rebrand the company for the first time in over 30 years. The end result was a complete website redesign and my position being updated to the only marketing team member for our company in 5 years.</p>
                <br>
                <p>BUSINESS ANALYST/PRODUCT MANAGER<br> OLIVERMCMILLAN | SAN DIEGO, CA | 2015-2016<br>
                • I had the opportunity to build, implement, and administrate software and related procedures that allowed OliverMcMillan to define and systematize its business process. My responsibilities varied from leading a development team in a ground-up build of multiple apps to end user training and understanding of pain points.</p>
                <br>
                <p>FRONT END DEVELOPER<br> WHAT.IT.IS CREATIVE | AUSTIN, TX | 2015<br>
                • In this position we built primarily WordPress based sites on a small team of 2 designers, myself, and one other developer. We were able to work closely with clients to help them navigate user concerns and business needs ranging from an app for children's stories/podcasts to a multi-national construction portfolio.</p>
                <br>
                <p>PROJECT MANAGER<br> STORYVILLE COFFEE | SEATTLE, WA | 2013-2014<br>
                • My function here was broad. With the function of the title of project manager being for both web development and construction, I was tasked with the continued perfection of aesthetic of the brand while building out and maintaining current store fronts. I built a web store and lead all levels of training staff for deployment. It was truly a "wear all the hats" job and I loved it!</p>
                <br>
                <p>PROJECT MANAGER<br> THE RESURGENCE | SEATTLE, WA | 2011-2012<br>
                • This position opened my eyes to a new level of frustrations that are a part of "modern" ministry. I saw friends and colleagues work tirelessly with little appreciation or reprieve and I experienced first-hand the way that affected the health of the church and its families. That became a driving force to seek changes that would positively influence the lives of everyone in ministry.</p>
                <br>
                <p>BOATSWAINS MATE/PROJECT MANAGER<br> USCG | SEATTLE, WA | 2009-2011<br>
                • As the department lead I was responsible for directing and training all newly deployed recruits as well as encouraging them towards specified training that best suited their strengths. I was young and they were younger, and for the first time I realized I cared more about how people were trained and developed than the end result.</p>

                <h1 id="Questions">Questions</h1>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> We'd like to get an understanding of how you see this role. What are your most and least favorite parts of product management? How do you do know if you're doing a good job?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> As a goal oriented person product management allows me to see physical progress in each facet of the project and helps to engage the social side of my personality in supporting the team. I’m a relational person by nature and the opportunity to invest in people is not only something I genuinely enjoy, but it allows them to work out of their strengths instead of being worried about weakness or fear.
                </p>
                <p>
                The hardest part of the job is when I want to be helpful and can’t. Sometimes it’s my lack of skill, time, or the greater needs of the project, but it’s always more fun to be part of the solution than bringing up challenges and not being able to help see them through.
                </p>
                <p>
                I think a job well done is when you have an active team that are excited about solving new problems and are asking challenging questions. Active to me means they're learning, pushing for better solutions, feel freedom to discuss frustrations, and have time to make mistakes. I’ve had jobs that make me feel bored even though I’m busy, and jobs that stress me out even though theres not a mountain of work to do. Management, team communication, and timeline visibility had a lot to do with those factors. If I’m successful those things will be freeing.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> What have you found to be effective frameworks/practices for product management?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> I’ve tried to stay away from latching on to any specific framework in the past. I’ve worked in environments where attempting Waterfall methods in a company that is already on the Agile end of the spectrum creates unnecessary confusion.</p>
                <p>What I try to implement are useful tools that allow for clear communication and increased visibility into project milestones. My requirements are only that they increase collaboration and add to the teams ability to get help when it’s needed.</p>
                <p>In that vein <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> is a tool I employ on 90% or projects. I like that it easily tracks ideas from the start and allows for things to be revisited easily with clear insight into what might have derailed them.
                I also try and use <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> as much as possible especially when there are remote team members. But I’m sure you need no introduction.</p>
                <p>Tools like <a href="https://www.kissmetrics.com/">Kissmetrics</a> and <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a> keep an eye on where users are entering, where they're spending timed where the biggest bounce rates happen, but those were primarily used for monitoring retention and sales outcomes and helping further design thinking within UX teams. If you have clear channels for direct user feedback it usually trumps the cost necessary to employ tools like this. </p>
                <p>As far as design, <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> was a really great tool that I wish I had more experience using. It was utilized at a smaller company I worked with in Austin for a few months and it really helped create feasibility studies for product features without getting deep into development. Id like to see how it’s progressed in the past two years.</p>
                <p>At the end of the day I attempt to on listening, ask thoughtful questions, communicating frequently and concisely, and helping where I can. Best practices and useful tools come as a team gets to know each other and learn their collective blind spots.</p>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> Products are made by people. What are some of the "tools" in your people management toolbox for fostering and leading healthy teams?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> I firmly believe that team health means a focus on the group and individuals separately. The group needs to know what the ground rules are. How do we work together, how do we address conflict, how do we argue, and what do we need to be successful. Team citizenship shouldn't be left to chance. Once effective teamwork has been defined, everyone holds everyone accountable, the team looks out for each other.</p> <p>BWith individuals the responsibility is for clear communication and learning what that means to the other person. We all speak different languages, have different emotional thresholds, backgrounds, fears, and frustrations. None of those should be met with assumptions, nor should situations be avoided if they are at an impasse.</p>
                <p>
                Regular communication as a team in the past has meant 30 minute stand-ups to check on progress and priorities as a group two or three times a week, daily one-on-one checkins to share in victories and incorporate help when its needed.
                </p>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> What is the work you're most proud of?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> The job that first brought me San Diego was the automation of business practices for a commercial real estate developer. I was given full access to the staff and as somewhat of an outsider I got pretty honest insight into everyones role, what they loved, what made it hard, and what bogged them down. </p>
                <p>It was amazing to take pain points and create software solutions with the ability to hear and see how much time people saved and the overall improvement on morale.</p>
                <p>The fact that their processes lived somewhere between email folders, massive excel files, and an insane amount of document management meant that the back and forth was a full time job. It was fun to see the work my team did quantified so concretely in everyones mood. Prior to which the products I’d created were solely measured by the profit they produced.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately as it’s not a public application I can’t share much, but here’s where I started:</p>

                </aside>
                <br>
                <p>And here's where that led to:</p>

                <br>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> Great feature design is often the result of healthy debate. Tell us about a time where there was a debate over a product feature. Describe the scenario and how the product was made better for it.</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> I believe that any healthy debate also includes complexity. Complexity most often includes a more lengthy explanation, and because of this I attempt to discuss complexity in person if at all possible. Please view my answer here: </p>

                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> From the job posting: "You've had experience with designing software solutions and aren't afraid to dive into software mockups." Can you show us some examples and walk us through your thought process?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> The past 3 years of my experience and those that I think are most applicable were built for fairly private organizations for which I've signed a few NDA's. It may feel a bit disjointed but I've created the process I follow from a few different projects.</p>
