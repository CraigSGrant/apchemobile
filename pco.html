                <p>Over the past six or seven years I have had the opportunity to watch Planning Center grow, both through using the product and interacting with your staff. As I have become familiar with how the company invests in its team, serves its churches, and continually seeks to innovate, Planning Center has come to be a company that I can't not apply for. After attending full-stack a few times and experiencing the humility of your team I have continually kept my eyes open for an opportunity to get to join and hopefully add value. Having worked in both administrative and managerial roles at churches in the past I've seen first hand the help and relief that PCO affords church staffs, and I would be ecstatic to continue in that service.</p>
                <p>My work experience has taken me down many paths, most of which have been on the project/product management and user experience side of the curtain. In that time I've learned that it's being ready to listen to teams and users rather than trying to be the smartest person in the room. It is serving in whatever capacity you can to be helpful with the church, the team, and the product in mind. I've seen that in Planning Center's DNA, and that's why I cant wait to be a part of it. </p>

                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> Tell us about a situation where you made a mistake when leading a team. What happened and how did you deal with it?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> My first soirée into managing a product team was also my first real encounter with working as part of a remote team. I was new to the role and new to the company and with a very active boss it became easy to get so wrapped up in my own workload that I wasn't making myself available to my team. Certain aspects of the project began struggling and for the most part it stemmed from either lack of direction, someone feeling stuck and not knowing how to ask for help, or simply a lack of awareness of blind spots with no-one to help bring a fresh perspective. Luckily one of the teams developers called me out. We talked about what he thought the solution could be and presented it to the team. The team agreed that I set aside times in the week to check in on members with the expectation that each check-in would take less than 5-10 minutes as to not disrupt their workflow, but that if there was an opportunity for me to be helpful that I could devote a solid chucnk of time to the situation if progress was being made.</p>

                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> Oh, wow. I think right now it has to be <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=%28roi%29%20branded&utm_content=ynab&utm_term=ynab&gclid=Cj0KCQjw4_zVBRDVARIsAFNI9eBnI1NEa9Mk_E50fshlWxy92ukEAhIs7Ah0aPm18NbVwtS6dFIYoPEaAp9yEALw_wcB#homeRuleOne">YNAB</a>.

                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> Tell us about a situation where you had to influence others who disagreed with you. What happened and how did you deal with it?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> I had been in my current role as a customer service rep for about three months, the company is small, and has been around for 30+ years. In the past 5 years they've seen turnover of ownership, fluctuating product focus, an unhealthy view from the target audience and had not pursued changing that perception. As a consumer of the product, and now an employee of the copmany, I was itching to do something. I was told there was no company time or money to spend on a rebrand, and no way we could change perception. "It is what it is, we just need to find new customers".</p> 
                <p>Being that I can be slightly... stubborn, I started reaching and found a designer and a copywriter that were willing to help me out in exchange for beer and food while we worked and the possibility of a product trade if we won over my team. After we dialed in our proposal I brought in our product director and VP of sales and pitched our work. We won them over not because it was perfect, but because we showed care, patience, took direction, and stayed positive. After having been at the company 8 months at this point we landed on new iconography, a new product line, and a brand/marketing guide. Patience, care, and communication won out. </p>
                <p class="question"><b>Q:</b> How did you hear about this job?</p>
                <p class="twelve columns"><b>A:</b> I check the site every few weeks for possible openings, but Dan Ott gave me the heads up this time around.</p>
